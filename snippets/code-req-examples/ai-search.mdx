Also known as the “City of Light,” is not only the capital but also the most populous city of France. Paris is renowned globally for its art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.\nParis has been an important hub of commerce, finance, science, music, and philosophy. Its rich history and cultural heritage make it a favored destination for tourists, academics, and artists.\nParis is nestled in the north-central part of France. The city is situated in a low-lying area on a bend of the Seine River, which divides it into two approximately equal parts.\nThe geographical coordinates of Paris are approximately 48.8566 °N latitude and 2.3522 °E longitude. This places it roughly in the middle of the western part of Europe and about midway between the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the central European countries to the east.\nYou’ll find the English Channel and the North Sea north and west of Paris. The rest of France lies to the south, including major cities like Lyon and Marseille and, further on, the Mediterranean Sea. To the east, you’ll find Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany.\nThe Seine River flows through Paris from the southeast to the northwest, shaping the city’s growth and development over the centuries. The river has multiple islands, two of which are Île de la Cité and Île Saint-Louis, in the city’s historical heart.\nParis has a rich and complex history that spans more than 2,000 years. It began as a small Celtic settlement known as Lutetia Parisiorum on the Île de la Cité, the island in the Seine that now hosts Notre-Dame Cathedral.\nDuring the Roman Empire, Lutetia grew into an important city with theater, baths, and a forum. In the late 3rd century, it was renamed Paris, after the Parisii, the Celtic tribe that had initially settled the area.\nIn the 5th century, as the Roman Empire declined, the Franks, a group of Germanic tribes, took control of the region. During this period, Clovis I made Paris his capital, marking the beginning of the Merovingian Dynasty and the city’s ascension to national prominence.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Paris blossomed as a center of learning and the arts. The University of Paris and Notre Dame were founded during this period. King Louis IX (Saint Louis) significantly improved the city’s reputation by acquiring religious relics and building Sainte-Chapelle to house them.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Paris grew in prominence and elegance under kings like Henry IV and Louis XIV. The Louvre, originally a fortress, was transformed into a magnificent royal palace, and vast public squares like the Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) were constructed.\nHowever, Paris only became the official capital of France during the reign of Clovis I, in the late 5th and early 6th century. Before Clovis, the Merovingian kings did not rule from a fixed capital, but Clovis established his court in Paris, effectively making it the capital. Since then, with some interruptions, Paris has remained the capital of France.\nIn the modern era, Paris underwent significant transformations under Napoleon Bonaparte and later Baron Haussmann, who redesigned the city’s layout in the mid-19th century, creating the broad boulevards and iconic architectural style today. Paris also played central roles in both World Wars in the 20th century.\nThe city’s complex history is reflected in its diverse architecture, which ranges from Roman and Medieval to Renaissance, Neoclassical, and modern styles. Each epoch has left a distinctive mark on the city’s character, making Paris a rich tapestry of historical and cultural experiences.\nParis is known for its many features and is home to some of the world’s most famous landmarks, making it one of the most visited cities in the world.\nParis is located in the Île-de-France region, the Paris Basin. The city spans an area of approximately 105.4 square kilometers and is crossed by the River Seine, which divides it into two distinct parts: the Right Bank to the north and the Left Bank to the south.\nParis is primarily flat, with Montmartre’s highest elevation 130 meters above sea level. It’s noted for its tree-lined boulevards and historic buildings. Outside the city, the landscape transitions into the agricultural lands that dominate much of France’s terrain.\nThe city has a Western European oceanic climate, which the North Atlantic Current influences. The overall climate is mild and moderately wet. Summers are warm, and winters are cold but not typically freezing.\nParis sees light rainfall throughout the year, with slightly heavier rain in late spring and early autumn. Average temperatures range from 5 °C in winter to 20 °C in summer. Snowfall is rare but does occur from time to time.\nThe population of the metropolitan area of Paris is around 11 million, making it one of the most populous urban regions in Europe.\nParis is a cosmopolitan city with a diverse population. French people of various backgrounds make up the majority, but there are significant communities from countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and China, among others. Paris is known for its multiculturalism, reflected in its vibrant food, music, and cultural scenes.\nThe official language is French, but given the city’s status as a global hub, many other languages are spoken, including English, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, and others.\nParis has one of the largest economies of any city in the world. It is considered a global city because of its influence in politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion, and the arts. It is one of the world’s leading business and cultural centers, with various economic activities.\nA combination of services and high-value-added manufacturing industries characterizes Paris’s economy. As the home of the CAC 40 (the French stock market index), the city is a central hub for finance, with many national and international banks and insurance companies headquartered there. The city is a leading center for high-tech industries, including information technology and software services.\nParis is globally recognized for its luxury goods, fashion, and cosmetics industries. Major French luxury brands like Chanel, Dior, and Louis Vuitton are headquartered in the city.\nTourism is another crucial role in the city’s economy, with millions of international visitors each year drawn to its historical sites, museums like the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, and its culinary and fashion scenes.\nThe economy of Paris is dynamic and diverse, providing a solid foundation for the city’s economic health and growth. While the city, like others, can face financial challenges, it has traditionally shown resilience due partly to its diverse economic portfolio.\nIt’s undeniable that Paris, with its array of stunning landmarks and attractions, holds a special allure for globetrotters. Here are some of the most coveted sights to behold and activities to engage in while in the City of Light:\nHoused in the Louvre Palace, the Louvre Museum was initially a fortress built in the late 12th to 13th century; it is a historical monument and the largest art museum in the world. With approximately 38,000 objects exhibited, dating from prehistoric times to the 21st century, the museum is a testament to Western art from the Middle Ages to 1848. It includes ancient civilizations that preceded and influenced this period.\nIts most famous pieces include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and the Code of Hammurabi. It is a place of historical, artistic, and cultural richness that requires careful exploration.\nA helpful tip for visiting the Louvre is to prepare in advance by choosing specific sections, as seeing everything in one day is practically impossible.\nWalking along the banks of the River Seine offers a different perspective on the City of Light. Lined with some of the city’s most beautiful monuments and bridges, the Seine River is the vein that pulses life into Paris. While wandering along the Seine, one can see the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Louvre, the Orsay Museum, and the Eiffel Tower.\nThe river’s quays are ideal for a romantic stroll, a picnic, or even a relaxing boat ride, and they come alive in the summer with the Paris Plages event, when sand and palm trees are brought in to create a city beach. Remember to stop at the bouquinistes – vendors who sell used and antique books in green boxes along the riverbank.\nThe Catacombs of Paris, part of a tunnel network that runs underneath much of the city, is a dark and eerie contrast to the city’s bright and bustling surface. They are an extensive collection of bones and ossuaries located deep under the city streets, housing the remains of over six million people.\nInitially, the catacombs were created as limestone quarries, extensively mined to construct some of Paris’s most famous buildings and bridges. However, by the end of the 18th century, the tunnels were repurposed into this unique and macabre repository due to the closure of the city’s overflowing and unsanitary cemeteries.\nVisiting the Catacombs of Paris is more than just a spooky adventure; it is a fascinating glimpse into the city’s history. There’s a strange beauty in the Catacombs, a sense of peace and eternity you won’t find in many places. But be aware; this experience is not for the faint-hearted. It’s damp and dark, and you’re surrounded by death. However, for those with a fascination for the eerie and a penchant for history, the Catacombs of Paris offers an intriguing journey through the city’s past.\nMontmartre, an area on a hill in the 18th arrondissement known for its bohemian spirit and artists who have frequented the site, is like a village within the city. Its history is deeply tied to art, with Salvador Dalí, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh among those who had studios or worked in Montmartre. The Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur, located at the summit, provides a panoramic view of Paris.\nThe nearby Place du Tertre, the historic home of the Parisian artists’ scene, still hosts painters and portraitists who work outside. The area is also home to the lively Rue des Abbesses, with its unique shops, cafes, restaurants, and the famed Moulin Rouge cabaret.\nThe Eiffel Tower, an iron lattice tower named after engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the structure, is one of the most iconic structures in the world. The tower stands at an impressive 330 meters (about 1,080 feet), making it the tallest structure in Paris.\nIt has three levels accessible to the public, with restaurants on the first and second and an observatory deck on the top level. Each level offers a unique perspective of the city. The Eiffel Tower becomes extraordinarily captivating at night, lighting a dazzling show every hour.\nThe Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon after his victory at Austerlitz in 1805, stands at the western end of the Champs-Élysées at the center of Place Charles de Gaulle. The monument, adorned with intricate sculptures and reliefs, pays tribute to the valiant individuals who bravely battled and sacrificed their lives for France during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I lies beneath the vault. The panoramic view from the top of the Arc, reached by climbing 284 steps, is truly remarkable and offers a 360-degree view over the rooftops of Paris.\nNestled on the left bank of the Seine, the Musée d’Orsay finds its home in the erstwhile Gare d’Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station erected between 1898 and 1900. The museum primarily showcases French art from 1848 to 1914, encompassing various forms such as paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography.\nPerhaps the museum is most renowned for its vast collection of impressionist and post-impressionist masterpieces crafted by luminaries like Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. A considerable proportion of these works were initially housed at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume before being transferred to the museum upon its inauguration in 1986.\nThe Notre Dame de Paris is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture, a style characterized by innovative use of the rib vault and flying buttress, colorful rose windows, and naturalistic and detailed sculpture. The construction of Notre Dame began in 1163 during the reign of King Louis VII and was completed in 1345, a process that took almost 200 years.\nFamous for its size, antiquity, and architectural interest, the cathedral is also known for its notable relics, such as the Crown of Thorns, the Holy Lance, and a fragment of the True Cross. While the cathedral suffered significant damage during a fire in April 2019, restoration efforts are ongoing, and even the exterior view remains a sight to behold.\nConstructed between 1861 and 1875 to serve as the opera house for the Paris Opera, the Palais Garnier is a marvel of architectural artistry. Its grandiose foyer, majestic marble staircase, and splendid auditorium, graced by a ceiling painting by Marc Chagall, render it a compelling visit, even if one doesn’t attend a performance.\nIts architecture is a marvel of theatre design and technology for its time. The Phantom of the Opera is set in this opera house, adding a touch of mystery and romance to it.\nThe Palace of Versailles, a royal residence in the Île-de-France, stands as a symbol of the unmitigated monarchy of the Ancien Régime. Its origins trace back to a hunting lodge established by Louis XIII, later transformed and expanded by his son Louis XIV, resulting in the relocation of France’s court and government to Versailles in 1682.\nIn the subsequent years leading up to the French Revolution, each of the French monarchs residing there contributed improvements, enhancing its beauty. Today, the public has access to a multitude of attractions within the Palace, including the Hall of Mirrors, the King’s Grand Apartments, the Museum of the History of France, the meticulously landscaped gardens, and the sprawling Park of Versailles, all of which are indeed a feast for the eyes.\nLocated in the heart of Paris on the Ile de la Cité, Sainte-Chapelle is a gem of Gothic style. It was built in the 13th century by King Louis IX to house his collection of Passion relics, including the Crown of Thorns – one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom.\nWith its stunning 15 stained glass windows depicting 1,113 scenes from the Old and New Testaments, the Sainte-Chapelle is often overshadowed by the nearby Notre Dame Cathedral, but it’s a masterpiece in its own right. The play of light on the glass and stone is an experience to be noticed.\nDisneyland Paris, originally Euro Disney Resort, is an entertainment resort in Chessy, France, a town located 32 km (20 mi) east of the center of Paris. It encompasses two theme parks, many resort hotels, Disney Nature Resorts, a shopping, dining, entertainment complex, a golf course, and several additional recreational and entertainment venues.\nA trip to Disneyland Paris can be a magical experience for families and Disney fans. From meeting beloved characters to enjoying thrilling rides and spectacular shows, there’s something for everyone.\nParis is home to some of the world’s most beautiful parks and gardens. The Jardin du Luxembourg is one of the city’s most beloved green spaces. It’s adorned with statues, fountains, and stunning flower arrangements, and it’s an ideal spot for a picnic or a stroll.\nThe park also features a large pond, tennis courts, and a puppet theater. On the other hand, the Tuileries Garden, located between the Louvre Museum and the Place de la Concorde, is a formal garden with beautifully arranged flower beds and trees.\nIt also boasts several statues, two ponds, and a carousel. Walking through these parks is like stepping into an impressionist painting, offering a respite from the bustling city life.\nThe optimal time to embark on a Parisian adventure is between April and June or from October to the onset of November. During these periods, the weather is pleasantly temperate, and the influx of tourists tends to be less overwhelming compared to the summer months.\nParis is renowned for its gastronomy and fantastic pastries and desserts like croissants, éclairs, macarons, tarte tatin, and of course, no Parisian meal would be complete without a glass of French wine.\nThere are several classic dishes that anyone visiting the city should try. Here are the top five traditional Parisian dishes:\n• Coq au Vin: This classic French dish, whose name translates to “rooster in wine,” is a slow-cooked chicken stewed with red wine, lardons (small strips or cubes of pork fat), mushrooms, and possibly garlic.\n• Bouillabaisse is a rich, flavorful seafood stew made with several different types of fish, shellfish, saffron, and various herbs and spices. It’s often served with a side of rouille, a garlicky mayonnaise-like sauce.\n• Escargot, a popular appetizer in French cuisine, is a dish of snails meticulously prepared in a scrumptious blend of garlic and parsley butter. Once cooked, the snails are placed back into their shells and served with designated utensils, a special fork, and tongs, enhancing the overall culinary experience.\n• Ratatouille: This dish from the South of France is also a staple in Paris. It’s a vegetable stew containing ingredients like eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions, seasoned with Herbes de Provence. It’s a delicious and healthy choice.\n• Crêpes: Originally from Brittany in the West of France, crêpes are thin pancakes that can be filled with various ingredients. Savory versions, made with buckwheat flour and known as galettes, might contain cheese, ham, eggs, or other fillings. Sweet crêpes, made with wheat flour, can be filled with sugar, Nutella, jam, or even flambeed with Grand Marnier for the classic Crêpe Suzette.\nFrench people place high importance on politeness. It’s customary to greet shopkeepers, waiters, hotel staff, and others with a “Bonjour” (Good day) during the day or “Bonsoir” (Good evening) at night. Try to learn a few basic French phrases; it will be appreciated.\nParis has an excellent public transportation system, including the Metro, buses, and trams. Bicycles are also popular, and the city is very pedestrian-friendly. Taxis and ride-sharing services are widely available as well.\nLike any major city, Paris has areas that are safer than others. It’s generally considered safe for tourists, but staying aware of your surroundings is still essential, especially in crowded tourist areas where pickpocketing can occur.\nThe currency used in Paris is the Euro (€).\nHow far is Disneyland Paris from the city center?\nDisneyland Paris is located approximately 40 kilometers east of the city center and can be reached by train in about 45 minutes.\nThe enchanting allure of Paris, a city steeped in rich history, vibrant culture, and unmatched beauty, is indisputable. With its iconic landmarks, world-class museums, delicious gastronomy, and charming neighborhoods, Paris presents a remarkable fusion of the old and new.\nFrom its well-manicured parks to the glimmering Seine River and from its cobbled lanes to its bustling café terraces, the city teems with unforgettable sights and experiences. Whether it’s your first visit or you’re a frequent traveler returning to rediscover its charm, Paris invariably has something fresh and exciting to offer.\nThe City of Light is, without a doubt, a must-visit destination for anyone looking to experience the quintessence of culture, art, and life itself.\nInteresting Facts\nTravel\nBuying Guides\nGeography Quizzes\nCopyright © 2025 Mappr\nSitemap",

The city has an approximate area of 41 square miles with a population of 2,206,488 people as of 2018. Contrary to popular belief, the name of the city did not come from the Paris in Greek myths. Instead, the name Paris is derived from the city’s initial inhabitants who were part of the Celtic Parisii tribe. Sometimes, the city is called the City of Light for two reasons; it was among the first cities to adopt gas for lighting the streets and its role during the Age of Enlightenment.\nLocated in the north of Central France, the city is relatively flat with the highest point being 427 feet (which is Montmartre) above sea level while the lowest point is 115 feet above the sea level. In a sentence, the climate of Paris can be described as being between mild and moderately wet throughout the year. Typical summer temperatures range between 59°F and 77°F or sometimes higher in case things like solar flares occur. Winter is decidedly cold although the temperatures stay above freezing point at around 37°F. On rare occasions, light snow may be seen although it never settles on the ground. The highest documented temperature for Paris is 104.7°F (1947) while the lowest is 11.0°F (1879).\nServices and commerce are the two main contributors to the prosperity of the city. The top 10 French Fortune Global 500 companies have their headquarters in or close to the city. With a GDP of approximately $850 billion, Paris is the country’s leader for economic activities. In 2011, the city emerged fourth in per-capita GDP rankings in Europe while it ranked second among Europe’s regions. Data from 2017 shows that the city is the seventh most expensive to live in globally and second in Europe with Zurich coming first.\nTourism has always been a major source of income for Paris. However, after terrorists attacked the city in 2015 and 2016, the sector has been adversely affected with tourism dropping by 11.5% in 2016. Tourists are attracted to Paris because of the rich history the city has including its monuments and sights. In 2016, the most popular tourist destination was the Notre Dame Cathedral with 12 million visitors. The popular museum, The Louvre, came in second with around 7 million visitors. Others include the likes of the National Museum of Natural History, the Centre Pompidou, the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, the Eiffel Tower, and many more.\nAs the capital city of France, the city plays host to the national government of France. Even the official residence of the president is in the city at the Élysée Palace while the Prime Minister is housed at the Hôtel Matignon. The Senate or the upper house meets at the Palais du Luxembourg while the Palais Bourbon is the meeting point for the Assemblée Nationale. The second highest public official after the President of France, the President of the Senate, stays at the Petit Luxembourg. International organizations who have headquarters in Paris include the likes of UNESCO, the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Federation for Human Rights, and a few others.\nAll maps, graphics, flags, photos and original descriptions © 2025 worldatlas.com",
