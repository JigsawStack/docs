description: "Extract data from any document type in a consistent structure with fine-tuned vLLMs for the highest accuracy."

## Introduction

The vOCR is a robust Object Character Recognition (OCR) API, enhanced with fine-tuned vLLMs, designed to efficiently extract data from various document types in a consistent structure.

**vOCR** shines at the following:

- KYC Automation: Streamlines the verification process by extracting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from documents to verify customer identity.
- Financial Data Extraction: Automates the extraction of financial data from statements, reports, and other financial documents for analysis and reporting.
- Healthcare Records Management: Extracts patient information, medical history, and treatment details from healthcare records for efficient data management and analysis.
- Classification Engines: Facilitates accurate categorization and organization of extracted data.

Let's see the vOCR in action by building a simple ID data extractor.

## Initial Steps

- Setup a JigsawStack account (if you don't have an account already)
- Get your JigsawStack API key from [here](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard).

## Example

### Request payload

```javascript
const params: BodyParams = await request.json();

// payload
const payload: OCRParams = {
  url: params.imageUrl,
  prompt: ["First name", "last name", "dob", "id"], // streamline to the data you need.
};
```

### Make request

```javascript
const result = await fetch("https://api.jigsawstack.com/v1/vocr", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "<your-api-key>", // Replace with your actual API key.
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

### Retrieve Result

```javascript
const data = await result.json();
```

### Here is the complete code

```javascript api/id-extractor.ts
export const POST = async (request: Request) => {
  try {
    const params: BodyParams = await request.json();
    const payload: OCRParams = {
      url: params.imageUrl,
      prompt: ["First name", "last name", "dob", "id"], // streamline to the data you need.
    };

    const result = await fetch("https://api.jigsawstack.com/v1/ai/vocr", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-api-key": "<your-api-key>", // Replace with your actual API key.
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    const data = await result.json();

    // Process and store data however you want to.

    return Response.json(
      {
        message: "ID verification successful",
      },
      {
        status: 200,
      }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```
