<Info>
  The file upload method is ideal for files that are not larger than 100MB.
</Info>

The file Storage will assume the content type of an asset from the file extension. However, you can specify specific file content types like `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, e.t.c

## Initial requirements

- Setup a JigsawStack account (if you don't have an account already)
- Get your `public` and `secret` API keys from [here](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard).
- Install the [Node.js SDK](http://localhost:3000/quick-start/node/introduction)

### Upload a file

<CodeGroup>

```javascript node.js
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const publicKey = "your-public-key";

const jigsawstack = JigsawStack({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const imageFile = fs.readFileSync("./beach_house.png");

const result = await jigsawstack.store.upload(imageFile, {
  filename: "beach_house.png",
});

// Attach your public key to make your uploaded file accessible
const publicFileUrl = `${result.url}?x-api-key=${publicKey}`;
```

```python python
from jigsawstack import JigsawStack

jigsawstack = JigsawStack(api_key="your-api-key")

try:
    with open("beach_house.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
        image_data = image_file.read()
        result = jigsawstack.store.upload(
            image_data, {"filename": "beach_house.jpg"}
        )
    print("Image uploaded successfully:", result)

except JigsawStackError as err:
    print(f"An error occurred: {err}")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Overwriting files

When uploading a file with a filename that already exists, the default behavior is to return a 400 file already exists error. If you want to overwrite a file that already exists, set `overwrite` to `true`

<CodeGroup>

```javascript node.js
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const publicKey = "your-public-key";

const jigsawstack = JigsawStack({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const imageFile = fs.readFileSync("./beach_house.png");

const result = await jigsawstack.store.upload(imageFile, {
  filename: "beach_house.png",
  overwrite: true,
});

// Attach your public key to make your uploaded file accessible
const publicFileUrl = `${result.url}?x-api-key=${publicKey}`;
```

```python python
from jigsawstack import JigsawStack

jigsawstack = JigsawStack(api_key="your-api-key")

try:
    with open("beach_house.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
        image_data = image_file.read()
        result = jigsawstack.store.upload(
            image_data, {"filename": "beach_house.jpg", "overwrite": True}
        )
    print("Image uploaded successfully:", result)

except JigsawStackError as err:
    print(f"An error occurred: {err}")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Content Type

By default, the File Storage will assume the content type of an asset from the file extension. If you want to specify the content type for your asset simply pass the contentType option during upload.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript node.js
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const publicKey = "your-public-key";

const jigsawstack = JigsawStack({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const imageFile = fs.readFileSync("./beach_house.png");

const result = await jigsawstack.store.upload(imageFile, {
  filename: "beach_house.png",
  overwrite: true,
  content_type: "image/png",
});
```

```python python
from jigsawstack import JigsawStack

jigsawstack = JigsawStack(api_key="your-api-key")

try:
    with open("beach_house.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
        image_data = image_file.read()
        result = jigsawstack.store.upload(
            image_data, {"filename": "beach_house.jpg", "overwrite": True}
        )
    print("Image uploaded successfully:", result)

except JigsawStackError as err:
    print(f"An error occurred: {err}")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Make your uploaded file accessible

Uploaded files are private by default. To make them public or accessible, attach your public key to the x-api-key query parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript node.js
const publicFileUrl = `${result.url}?x-api-key=${publicKey}`;
```

```python python
 publicFileUrl = f"{result.url}?x-api-key={publicKey}";
```

</CodeGroup>
