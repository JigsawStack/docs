## Data protection

#### 1. Data at rest

All sensitive data are encrypted at rest. Sensitive collections and tables also use row-level encryption.

#### 2. Data in transit

JigsawStack uses TLS 1.3 or higher everywhere data is transmitted over potentially insecure networks.

#### 3. Data backup

JigsawStack backs-up all production data using a point-in-time approach. Backups are persisted for 30 days, and are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters.

## Prevent logging API requests

By default, our servers logged every request payload. Attach the header parameter `x-jigsaw-no-request-log` to control how requests payload are handled. If set to `true`, request payload will not be logged (stored).

```javascript
const headers = {
  "x-api-key": "<your-api-key-here>",
  "x-jigsaw-no-request-log": "true",
};

const baseUrl = "https://api.jigsawstack.com";

const result = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/ai/summary`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    text: "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, or simply, the Tower of Pisa, is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral",
  },
  headers,
});
```
