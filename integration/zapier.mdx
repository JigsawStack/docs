You can add it to your Zapier account by heading to the [integration page](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/197557/6d18c8ca2d850c06bd6c93868e232081/)

Some APIs available in JigsawStack may not be available in the Zapier Create Article action. If there's anything missing that you're keen to use, get in touch with hello@jigsawstack.com
