The new `window.ai` Chrome API (currently available only in Chrome Canary) introduces native AI models that run locally and completely offline within the web environment.

However, it's not yet widely available or compatible across different devices and browsers, and it currently supports only a small language model, which limits its use cases. Despite these limitations, the potential for this technology is significant.

JigsawStack enhances this by integrating a suite of powerful AI utilities into the `window.ai` object. Here's how you can use it:

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:

- **Set up an** [account](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard)
- **Create and retrieve your** [Public key](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard)

<Info>
  We recommend using your `public key` for client-side access. To enhance
  security and control, you can further restrict the `public key` to specific
  APIs. For more information,
  [visit](https://docs.jigsawstack.com/api-reference/authentication#public-and-secret-api-keys)
</Info>

## Installation

```javascript script.js
const jigsawstack = JigsawStack({ apiKey: "pk_fecc....92je9" });
window.ai = jigsawstack;
```

## Usage

```javascript
window.ai.sentiment("I love how easy it is to get started");
```

- For typescript projects, you can add JigsawStack types to `window.ai` by doing the following:

```javascript
//index.d.ts
import type { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

declare global {
  interface Window {
    ai: ReturnType<typeof JigsawStack>;
  }
}

export {};
```
