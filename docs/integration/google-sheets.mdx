You can call all of JigsawStackâ€™s AI tools just like a regular spreadsheet formula.

## Parameters and Return Types
Each JigsawStack function has a set of parameters and a return type. You can find more information on each parameter by clicking
on the dropdown menu in the custom function.

</Warning>

## Error Handling
Errors are shown by hovering over the cell with the error. We try out best to provide a clear error message but there 
are some limitations from Google Sheets. 

Here is an example of an error message with incorrect parameters passed:

<Note>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Loading will also show a similar error message. This is unavoidable and is due to the way Google Sheets handles custom functions.

## Cache
### Refreshing a specific cell 
By default JigsawStack's results are automatically cached in your sheets. To refresh the value of a specific cell, 
- Click on the Cell you want to refresh 
- On the keyboard type `cmd + r` (or `ctrl + r` for Windows) 

This will trigger a new call to our API, refreshing the value of that cell.

### Refreshing an entire sheet
You can also refresh ALL cell in a sheet by navigating to Extensions > JigsawStack > Refresh All Formulas

<Note>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Refresh All Formulas, will clear all your existing cache.
