```javascript
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const jigsawstack = JigsawStack({
  apiKey: "your-api-key", // This is not required if API key is set as an environment variable.
});

const resp = await jigsawstack.web.ai_scrape({
  url: "https://www.amazon.com/Cadbury-Mini-Caramel-Eggs-Bulk/dp/B0CWM99G5W",
  element_prompts: ["prices"],
});
```
