## Overview

The Text to Speech API converts written text into lifelike speech with options for:

- Multiple languages and accents (700+ different voices)
- Voice cloning from audio samples
- High-quality, natural-sounding output

## Request Parameters

### Body

<ParamField body="text" type="string" required>
  The text to generate speech from. Character Limits: - Standard TTS: 5-1,500 characters - Voice Cloning TTS: 5-500 characters
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="accent" type="string" default="en-US-female-27">
  Speaker voice accent. Not required if using voice cloning. Over 700 different voices across multiple languages are available. See the [Speaker Voice
  Accents documentation](https://docs.jigsawstack.com/additional-resources/speaker-voices) for the complete list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_clone_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for a previously cloned voice. When provided, the API will generate speech using this pre-cloned voice profile instead of
  creating a new one.
</ParamField>

<Info>
  Only one voice source is needed. You can either specify an `accent` for built-in voices, or provide a `voice_clone_id` for the voice that has been previously cloned.

## Response

The API returns the generated audio file directly in the response body as binary data, typically in MP3 format.

## Popular Voice Accents

Here's a selection of commonly used voice accents:

### English Voices

- `en-US-female-27` (Default) - American English, Female 27
- `en-US-male-24` - American English, Male 24
- `en-GB-female-2` - British English, Female 2

- `zh-CN-female-15` - Chinese (Mandarin), Female 15

## Voice Cloning

Voice cloning allows you to generate speech that mimics a specific voice from an audio sample. This is useful for creating custom voices for applications, personalized assistants, or consistent brand voices.

### Using Voice Cloning

1. Provide a clear audio sample using either:

   - `speaker_clone_url` - Direct URL to an audio file
   - `speaker_clone_file_store_key` - Key to a file in Jigsawstack storage

2. Provide the text you want to convert to speech (maximum 500 characters)

3. The API will analyze the sample and generate speech with similar voice characteristics

### Best Practices for Voice Cloning

- Use high-quality audio samples with minimal background noise
- Samples should be clear speech without music or other voices
- Longer samples (30+ seconds) provide better voice modeling
- For best results, the sample should contain speech similar in tone and style to your desired output

## Getting Available Voices

To retrieve the complete list of available voices programmatically:

```javascript
const voices = await jigsawstack.audio.speaker_voice_accents();
console.log(voices);
```

```python
voices = jigsawstack.audio.speaker_voice_accents()
print(voices)
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Content Creation**: Generate voiceovers for videos, podcasts, and presentations
- **Accessibility**: Convert written content to audio for visually impaired users
- **Interactive Applications**: Build voice assistants, language learning apps, and interactive experiences
- **Customer Service**: Create automated voice responses for customer service systems
- **Localization**: Translate and vocalize content in multiple languages
- **Personalization**: Clone a specific voice for consistent brand messaging
