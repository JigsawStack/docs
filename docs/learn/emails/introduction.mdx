## Understand email events

> Here are all the events that can be associated with an email:

- `Sent` - The API request was successful and JigsawStack will attempt to deliver the message to the recipient’s mail server.
- `Delivered` - JigsawStack successfully delivered the email to the recipient’s mail server.
- `Delivery Delayed` - The email couldn’t be delivered to the recipient’s mail server because a temporary issue occurred. Delivery delays can occur, for example, when the recipient’s inbox is full, or when the receiving email server experiences a transient issue.
- `Complained` - The email was successfully delivered to the recipient’s mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam.
- `Bounced` - The recipient’s mail server permanently rejected the email.
