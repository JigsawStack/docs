JigsawStack implements caching to improve API performance and reduce latency for your applications. When a request is cached, subsequent identical requests will return faster by serving the cached response instead of processing the request again.


## Cache Duration

The cache automatically resets every **24 hours**. After this period, new requests will fetch fresh data and update the cache accordingly.

<Note>
  <p>
    Skipping the cache may result in slightly increased response times as each request will be processed fresh. Use this option judiciously to balance between data freshness and performance.
  </p>
</Note>

## How to Skip Cache

If you need to bypass the cache and retrieve fresh data, you can include the `x-jigsaw-skip-cache` header in your requests.

### JavaScript SDK

To skip caching in the JavaScript SDK, pass the `x-jigsaw-skip-cache` header during initialization:

```javascript setup.ts
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const jigsaw = JigsawStack({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  headers: {
    "x-jigsaw-skip-cache": "true",
  },
});
```

### Python SDK

In the Python SDK, include the `x-jigsaw-skip-cache` header when creating a JigsawStack instance:

```python setup.py
from jigsawstack import JigsawStack

jigsaw = JigsawStack(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    headers={
        "x-jigsaw-skip-cache": "true",
    },
)
```

### API

When using the raw API, include the `x-jigsaw-skip-cache` header in your request:

```javascript
const headers = {
  "x-api-key": "<your-api-key-here>",
  "x-jigsaw-skip-cache": "true",
};

const baseUrl = "https://api.jigsawstack.com";

const result = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/ai/summary`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, or simply, the Tower of Pisa, is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral",
  }),
  headers,
});
```

## When to Skip Cache

Consider skipping the cache in the following scenarios:

- **Real-time data requirements**: When you need the absolute latest information and cannot tolerate any delay from cached data
- **Critical updates**: After making changes that affect the data, and you need to verify the updated results immediately
- **Testing and debugging**: When developing or troubleshooting to ensure you're seeing current behavior
