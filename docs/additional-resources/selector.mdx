## What are CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to define a pattern of the elements that you want to select for applying a set of CSS rules on the selected elements.

| Selector                           | Example                    | Use Case Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \*                                 | `*`                        | This selector picks all elements within a page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| .class                             | `.card-title`              | The simplest CSS selector is targeting the class attribute. If only your target element is using it, then it might be sufficient.                                                                                                                                                          |
| .class1.class2                     | `.card-heading.card-title` | There are elements with a class like class=“card-heading card-title”. When we see a space, it is because the element is using several classes. However, there’s no one fixed way of selecting the element. Try keeping the space, if that doesn’t work, then replace the space with a dot. |
| #id                                | `#card-description`        | What if the class is used in too many elements or if the element doesn’t have a class? Picking the ID can be the next best thing. The only problem is that IDs are unique per element. So won’t cut to scrape several elements at once.                                                    |
| element                            | `h4`                       | To pick an element, all we need to add to our parser is the HTML tag name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| element.class                      | `h4.card-title`            | This is the most common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| parentElement > childElement       | `div > h4`                 | We can tell our scraper to extract an element inside another. In this example, we want it to find the h4 element whose parent element is a div.                                                                                                                                            |
| parentElement.class > childElement | `div.card-body > h4`       | We can combine the previous logic to specify a parent element and extract a specific CSS child element. This is super useful when the data we want doesn’t have any class or ID but is inside a parent element with a unique class/ID.                                                     |
| [attribute]                        | `[href]`                   | Another great way to target an element with no clear class to choose from. Your scraper will extract all elements containing the specific attribute.                                                                                                                                       |
| [attribute=value]                  | `[target=_blank]`          | We can tell our scraper to extract only the elements with a specific value inside its attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [attribute~=value]                 | `[title~=rating]`          | This selector will pick all the elements containing the word ‘rating’ inside its title attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| element,element                    | `div, p`                   | Selects all `<div>` elements and all `<p>` elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| element+element                    | `div + p`                  | Selects the first `<p>` element that is placed immediately after `<div>` elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [attribute^=value]                 | `a[href^="https"]`         | Selects every `<a>` element whose href attribute value begins with "https"                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [attribute*=value]                 | `a[href*="jigsawstack"]`   | Selects every `<a>` element whose href attribute value contains the substring "jigsawstack"                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :active                            | `a:active`                 | Selects the active link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :link                              | `a:link`                   | Selects all unvisited links                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
