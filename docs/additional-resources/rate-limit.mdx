---

JigsawStack implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain API stability for all users. Rate limits are applied on a per-project basis.

We support up to 50 requests per second. When exceeded, the API returns a 429 status code with corresponding headers. If you need higher limits, please [reach out to us](https://jigsawstack.com/help).

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers that provide information about your current rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-limit` | The maximum number of requests allowed per second |
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current window |
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-reset` | Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the rate limit window resets |

### Example Response Headers

```
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-limit: 50
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-remaining: 45
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-reset: 1706025600000
```
