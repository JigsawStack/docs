JigsawStack implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain API stability for all users. Rate limits are applied on a per-project basis and vary depending on your subscription plan.

## Rate Limit Tiers

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|
| Free | 50 requests/second |
| Pro | 50 requests/second |
| Custom | Contact [support@jigsawstack.com](mailto:support@jigsawstack.com) |

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers that provide information about your current rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-limit` | The maximum number of requests allowed per second |
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current window |
| `x-jigsaw-rate-limit-reset` | Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the rate limit window resets |

### Example Response Headers

```
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-limit: 50
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-remaining: 45
x-jigsaw-rate-limit-reset: 1706025600000
```
