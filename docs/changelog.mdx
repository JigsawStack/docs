<Update label="September 29, 2025" description="API Fixes and Updates" tags={["DOCS", "Fixes", "APIs"]}>

### Fixes
- Fixed **Embedding v1** API where sometimes the model would fail inconsistently 
- Fixed **Classification** API where the model would fail inconsistently for certain images
- Fixed **AI Scraper** where the model would fail for pdf with large amount of pages

### APIs
- **Speech to Text (STT):** Added confidnece score for the language detected. Available if language parameter is not provided or set to “auto”. 
- **Object to Detection:**: Improved the speed of the object detection model
- Improved the speed of APIs that involves processing binary data. This includes:
    - Object Detection
    - Speech to Text (STT)
    - Embedding v1
    - Embedding v2
    - Image Translation
    - vOCR
    - NSFW 
    - File Upload

### DOCS
- Introduced JigsawStack Google Sheets integration 
- Added confidence score for the language detected in the STT API
- Added warning for the deprecated Image Generation API


</Update>

<Update label="September 19, 2025" description="Python v0.3.7, JavaScript v0.3.6" tags={["DOCS", "Fixes", "SDKs"]}>

### Fixes
- Updated **Object Detection** API to accept "object" parameter as an alternative to "object_detection"
- Fixed **Object Detection** API for pure GUI images
- Improved **Speech to Text (STT)** webhook error handling with 400 status code for empty files
- Enhanced **Object Detection** tag generation for more accurate and relevant results

### SDKs
- Updated **Object Detection** now supports "object" parameter as an alternative to "object_detection"
- Updated **Speech to Text (STT)** to return `language_detected` and `confidence` in the response

### DOCS
- Added documentation for [Embedding v2](/docs/embedding-v2) parameters: `instructions` and `query`
- Added documentation for [Object Detection](/docs/object-detection) parameters: `return_masks`
- Fixed CURL example for [File Uploads](/docs/store/file/add)
- Fixed C# examples on all APIs 
- Updated [Speech to Text (STT)](/docs/api-reference/ai/speech-to-text) documentation to include parameters: `chunk_duration`, `language_detected`, and `confidence`


</Update>


<Update label="September 15, 2025" description="v0.3.4 - v0.3.5" tags={["SDKs", "Fixes", "DOCS"]}>
### Fixes

- Added support for **HTML to Any** now works with all HTML tags as input
- Fixed **File Upload** now works with Embedding v2
- Fixed **VOCR** for PDF in certain edge cases
- Fixed **AI Scraper** returning invalid JSON for empty element_prompts 
- Decrease latency for **AI Scraper**

### DOCS
- Updated File Uploads documentation (Handling Files)[/docs/handling-files]
- Renamed embeddingV2 method to embedding_v2 for consistency

### SDKs

#### Python 
- Fixed blob inputs for **Object Detection** where previously features params was not respected
- Fixed blob inputs for **VOCR** where page range was not respected
- Established CI/CD pipeline for Python SDK
- Updated to pass **x-jigsaw-no-request-log** through headers. (Security)[/docs/security]

#### JavaScript
- Fixed blob inputs for **Object Detection** where previously features params was not respected
- Fixed blob inputs for **VOCR** where page range was not respected

- params: `speaker_fingerprint` a boolean value to switch on/off speaker identification.
- response: `speaker_embeddings` a list of embeddings for the speaker.

### Fixes
- fixed **Speech to Text (STT)** webhook 
- fixed **file upload** overwrites error

### API
