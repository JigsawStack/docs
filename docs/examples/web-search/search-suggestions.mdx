## Tips for Effective Search Suggestions

1. **Start with partial queries**: Use incomplete search terms to get the most relevant suggestions (e.g., "what is the capital" instead of full questions)
2. **Keep queries short**: Shorter queries typically generate more diverse and useful suggestions
3. **Use common search patterns**: Leverage popular search formats like "how to", "what is", "best", etc. to get high-quality suggestions
