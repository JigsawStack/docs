## Overview

The Web Search API provides access to high-quality search results with built-in AI overviews, comprehensive metadata, and geo-spatial search capabilities. This API makes it easy to integrate powerful search functionality into your applications while also providing location-based context for search queries.

- Get comprehensive search results with rich metadata
- AI-generated overviews for quick content digestion
- Built-in geo search capabilities for location-aware applications
- Safe search filtering options
- Customizable search parameters

## API Endpoint
```
POST /v1/web/search
```

## Quick Start

```javascript Javascript
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const jigsaw = JigsawStack({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

const response = await jigsaw.web.search({
  query: "capital of France",
  ai_overview: true,
  safe_search: "moderate"
});

console.log(response);
console.log(response.geo_results[0].geoloc);
```

## Response 

```json

  "success": true,
  "query": "capital of France",
  "ai_overview": "The capital of France is Paris. It has been the capital since its liberation in 1944.",

}
```



## Working with Geo Results

The API automatically includes geolocation data when relevant to your search query. The `geo_results` array contains location information with the following structure:

- `type`: Type of location (place, street, etc.)
- `name`: Name of the location
- `place_formatted`: Formatted place name
- `country`: Country information
- `geoloc`: GeoJSON object with coordinates
- Additional fields depending on the location type

## Examples

### Basic Search

```javascript
const basicSearch = await jigsaw.web.search({
  query: "best restaurants in New York",
});

console.log(basicSearch.ai_overview);
console.log(basicSearch.results.length);
```

### Location-Based Search

```javascript
const locationSearch = await jigsaw.web.search({
  query: "nearest national parks",
  country_code: "USA", 
});

// Access geo results
locationSearch.geo_results.forEach(location => {
  console.log(`${location.name}: ${location.geoloc.coordinates}`);
});
```

### Custom URL Inclusion

```javascript
const customSearch = await jigsaw.web.search({
  query: "climate change solutions",
  byo_urls: [
    "https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/",
    "https://climate.nasa.gov/solutions/resources/"
  ],
  ai_overview: true
});
```


## Tips for Effective Searches

1. **Be specific**: More detailed queries yield more precise results
2. **Use location context**: For geo-aware searches, include location names in your query
3. **Leverage AI overviews**: Enable `ai_overview` to get concise summaries of search results
4. **Filter appropriately**: Use `safe_search` levels based on your application needs
5. **Consider rate limits**: Be mindful of your API usage limits, especially for high-volume applications
