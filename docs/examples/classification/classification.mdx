## Overview

The Classification API is a powerful tool that can classify literally anything. This advanced API is perfect for automation, testing, and building intelligent applications that need to understand the content of the data.
**Classification** excels at the following:

- Crosslingual Text Classification: Classify text content across multiple languages without requiring language-specific training or models.
- Moderation and Intent Classification: Automatically identify inappropriate content, spam, or determine user intent from messages and support tickets.
- Multi-label Tagging Classification: Apply multiple relevant tags and categories to content simultaneously for better organization and searchability.
- Context-Aware Image Classification: Classify real-world images with understanding of context, objects, scenes, and situations using descriptive labels.


## API Endpoint

```
POST /v1/classification
```


## Quick Start

```javascript JavaScript
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const jigsaw = JigsawStack({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

const response = await jigsaw.classification({
  "dataset": [
        {
              "type": "image",
              "value": "https://jigsawstack.com/preview/classification-example-1.jpg"
        },
        {
              "type": "image",
              "value": "https://jigsawstack.com/preview/classification-example-2.jpg"
        }
  ],
  "labels": [
        {
              "type": "text",
              "value": "hotdog"
        },
        {
              "type": "text",
              "value": "not a hotdog"
        }
  ]
})
```

## Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "predictions": [
        "not a hotdog",
        "hotdog"
  ],
  "_usage": {
        "input_tokens": 69,
        "output_tokens": 14,
        "inference_time_tokens": 3457,
        "total_tokens": 3540
  }
}
```
## Use Cases & Applications

### Content Moderation

Automatically classify user-generated content to maintain platform standards and safety.
- **Example**: Classify images as "safe", "inappropriate", or "needs review" for social media platforms.
- **Implementation**: Use custom labels to categorize content based on your platform's guidelines, with an "unknown" label to handle edge cases.

### E-commerce Product Categorization

Classify product images into relevant categories for better organization and searchability.
- **Example**: Automatically sort uploaded product images into categories like "electronics", "clothing", "home goods", or "other".
- **Implementation**: Define your product categories as labels and let the API classify new inventory images, reducing manual categorization work.

### Document Classification

Organize and route documents based on their content and visual characteristics.
- **Example**: Classify scanned documents as "invoice", "receipt", "contract", "form", or "unknown document type".
- **Implementation**: Use the classification API to automatically sort incoming documents for processing workflows.

### Medical Image Analysis

Assist healthcare professionals by providing preliminary classifications of medical imagery.
- **Example**: Classify X-rays, MRIs, or other medical images into diagnostic categories or flag for specialist review.
- **Implementation**: Create labels for different conditions or anatomical features, with careful handling of uncertain cases.
