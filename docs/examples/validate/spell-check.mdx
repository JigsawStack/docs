## FAQ

### How does the spell checker handle proper nouns?

The spell checker is designed to recognize common proper nouns like names, brands, and places. However, very new, uncommon, or industry-specific proper nouns might be flagged as misspellings. If your content contains many specialized terms, consider building a custom dictionary for your specific use case.

### Does the spell checker recognize technical terminology?

The spell checker includes common terminology from various fields including technology, medicine, law, and science. For highly specialized content, it's recommended to review corrections rather than applying them automatically.

### Can I use the spell checker for languages other than English?

Yes, the spell checker supports multiple languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. Make sure to specify the correct language_code parameter for the language of your text to get accurate results.
