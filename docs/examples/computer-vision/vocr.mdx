## Introduction

The vOCR is a robust Object Character Recognition (OCR) API, enhanced with fine-tuned vLLMs, designed to efficiently extract data from various document types in a consistent structure.

**vOCR** shines at the following:

- KYC Automation: Streamlines the verification process by extracting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from documents to verify customer identity.
- Financial Data Extraction: Automates the extraction of financial data from statements, reports, and other financial documents for analysis and reporting.
- Healthcare Records Management: Extracts patient information, medical history, and treatment details from healthcare records for efficient data management and analysis.
- Classification Engines: Facilitates accurate categorization and organization of extracted data.

Let's see the vOCR in action by building a data extractor.
