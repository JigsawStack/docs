The JigsawStack API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the JigsawStack Dashboard.
Attach the header parameter `x-api-key` with the API key obtained from your dashboard.

```bash
"x-api-key": "<your-api-key>"
"Content-Type": "application/json"
```

## To retrieve your api key

- Log in to your JigsawStack [dashboard](https://dash.jigsawstack.com)
- Navigate to Keys tab.
- Click on `Create new key` button to create a new api key.
- Copy the api key and use it in your requests.

## Public and Secret API keys

The JigsawStack API has two types of API keys: `public` and `secret`.

- Public API keys are great for frontend applications and APIs required to be called on the front end. Requires API restriction to be set.

<Tip>Domain whitelisting is recommended when creating `public` api keys.</Tip>

- Secret API keys are great for backend services. Has access to all APIs.

<Tip>
  Your `secret` API key should never be public, shared or exposed in a github
  repository.
