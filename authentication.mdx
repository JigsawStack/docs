The JigsawStack API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the JigsawStack Dashboard.

## Authenticated request

Attach the header parameter `x-api-key` with the API key obtained from your dashboard.

```js
const headers = {
  "x-api-key": "<your-api-key-here>",
};
const baseUrl = "https://api.jigsawstack.com";

const result = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/currency`, {
  headers,
});
```

## To retrieve your API key

- Log in to your JigsawStack [dashboard](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard)
- Navigate to Keys tab.
- Click on `Create new key` button to create a new api key.
- Copy the api key and use it in your requests.

## Public and Secret API keys

The JigsawStack API has two types of API keys: `public` and `secret`.

- Public API keys are great for frontend applications and APIs required to be called on the front end. Requires API restriction to be set.

<Tip>Domain whitelisting is recommended when creating `public` api keys.</Tip>

- Secret API keys are great for backend services. Has access to all APIs.

<Tip>
  Your `secret` API key should never be public, shared or exposed in a github
  repository.
