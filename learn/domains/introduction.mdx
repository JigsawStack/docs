## What is a domain

A domain is used to send emails and custom link redirects using your own domain. Verifying a domain is a required step because it’s essential to ensuring the your emails get delivered as well as link redirects working accordingly.

In order to verify a domain, you must set the DNS entries that grant us permission to use the domain to send emails on your behalf and perform links redirects.

### Add Domain

- Under the Settings tab, select Domains and click on the `Add Domain` button

### What are SPF records

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication standard that allows you to list all the IP addresses that are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain.

The SPF configuration is made of a TXT record that lists the IP addresses approved by the domain owner. It also includes a MX record that allows the recipient to send bounce and complaint feedback to your domain.

### What are DKIM records

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email security standard designed to make sure that an email that claims to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.

The DKIM configuration is made of a TXT record that contains a public key that is used to verify the authenticity of the email.

### Understand a domain status

> Domains can have different statuses, including:

- Not Started: you’ve added a domain, but you haven’t clicked on Verify DNS Records yet.
- Pending: We are still trying to verify the domain.
- Verified: your domain is successfully verified for sending in JigsawStack.
- Failure: JigsawStack was unable to detect the DNS records within 72 hours.
- Temporary Failure: for a previously verified domain, JigsawStack will periodically check for the DNS record required for verification. If at some point, we are unable to detect the record, the status would change to “Temporary Failure”. We will recheck for the DNS record for 72 hours, and if it’s unable to detect the record, the domain status would change to “Failure”. If it’s able to detect the record, the domain status would change to “Verified”.
