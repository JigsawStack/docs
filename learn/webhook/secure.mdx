Webhooks are not secured by default. To secure your webhook, You need to generate a key on your own server, attach it as a parameter in the webhook url and verify on your server.

### Example.

1. Generate a random secured webhook key.

```javascript
const webhookKey = generateWebhookKey();
```

2. Add the key as a query parameter to your webhook URL

```javascript
const webhookUrl =
  "https://your-domain.com/webhook/email?webhookKey=${webhookKey}";
```

3. Attach webhook to request payload

```javascript
const endpoint = "https://api.jigsawstack.com/v1/email";
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "<your-api-key>", // Replace with your actual API key.
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    from: "name@your-email.com",
    to: "hello@jigsawstack.com",
    subject: "Jigsawstack, You Rock!",
    html: "<p>Hi Team, you are awesome.</p>",
    webhook_url: webhookUrl, // your webhook url here.
  }),
};
const result = await fetch(endpoint, options);
const data = await result.json();
```

4. Verify public key on your server.

- Extract the webhook key parameter from the webhook URL.
- Compare the extracted webhook key with the expected webhook key on your server.

```javascript
// On your server, you do something like this:

const requestBody = await request.json();

const parsedUrl = new URL(requestBody.webhookUrl);

const webhookKey = parsedUrl.searchParams.get("webhookKey");

// Proceed to verify the public key

const result = await verifyWehhooKey(webhookKey);
```
