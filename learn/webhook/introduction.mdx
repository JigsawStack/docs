## What is a webhook

Webhooks are used to push real-time data to you about changes(updates) to certain API requests. All webhooks use HTTPS and deliver a JSON payload that can be used by your application. You can use webhook feeds to do things like:

- Create alerts in your messaging or incident tools based on event types
- Store all payload events in your own database for custom reporting/retention
- Update the status of an async request in your application.

### 1. For Logs

> Enable webhook for the [Logs API](https://docs.jigsawstack.com/api-reference/logs/create-log).

- Under the Settings tab, select Webhook
- Enable the type of logs to receive i.e `Success logs` or `Error logs`
- Enable to webhook URL. E.g `http://your-domain.com/webhook/log/`

### 2. For Emails

> Receive email log events

- Attach the webhook url to the email body parameters. See example below:

```javascript
const endpoint = "https://api.jigsawstack.com/v1/email";
const options = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "<your-api-key>", // Replace with your actual API key.
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    from: "name@your-email.com",
    to: "hello@jigsawstack.com",
    subject: "Jigsawstack, You Rock!",
    html: "<p>Hi Team, you are awesome.</p>",
    webhook_url: "http://your-domain.com/webhook/email", // attach your webhook url here.
  }),
};
const result = await fetch(endpoint, options);
const data = await result.json();
```
