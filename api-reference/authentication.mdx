The JigsawStack API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the JigsawStack Dashboard.
Attach the header parameter x-api-key with the API key obtained from your dashboard.

```bash
'api_key': '<your-api-key>'
'Content-Type": "application/json'
```

## To retrieve your api key

- Log in to your JigsawStack dashboard.
- Navigate to Settings
- Select the API Key tab to view and copy your key.
