The JigsawStack API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the JigsawStack Dashboard.
Attach the header parameter x-api-key with the API key obtained from your dashboard.

```bash
"x-api-key": "<your-api-key>"
"Content-Type": "application/json"
```

## To retrieve your api key

- Log in to your JigsawStack [dashboard](https://dash.jigsawstack.com)
- Navigate to Keys tab.
- Click on `Create new key` button to create a new api key.
- Copy the api key and use it in your requests.
